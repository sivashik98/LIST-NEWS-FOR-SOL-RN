# list-news-ReactNative 

test task

# Steps to run app(much easier perform all the steps via git bush or simple console).

1. First off you need to clone my project(`git clone https://github.com/sivashik98/list-news-ReactNative.git`)
in your any directory(You can just create simple test folder and clone in it)

2. You need to enter downloaded folder(in console you should write the following command: `cd list-news-ReactNative/`)

3. Now you have to install modules to run the whole app(following command: `yarn install` or `npm install`) but before you need to make sure you have node js on your PC
if you don't have you should install here https://nodejs.org/en/ and install it. After installing npm will appear.

4. After installing modules you need to connect you android phone to PC via wire. When PC will locate your phone you need to run this command in console in the same directory
`npx react-native run-android --variant=release`. It will build the release built app to test the task. It's the same as I would publish my app in google play market.
But unfortunatly I don't have develop account there now.
